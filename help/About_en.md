# Trinary University

This is an Unreal Engine Simulator (Game) based on the Trinary University, a 666-page Physics Ph.D. textbook titled ["The Principles of Trinary Universe"](https://github.com/Light-Wizzard/The-Principles-Of-The-Trinary-Universe/blob/master/misc/the.principles.of.the.trinary.universe.pdf).

I started this in December of 2022, and hope to have it finished early next year.

This Simulator is based on the Science of Johannes Kepler, Sir Isaac Newton, and Nikola Tesla, and not Albert Einstein since no one uses his Science, or can use it since Einstein removed God from his Alternate Universe in an Alternate Reality, so unless you live in one of those that does not include God, then your grasp on Physics is insane since the Torah and Bible define God as all Light without Darkness, and we know that is found inside Atoms, thus Einstein has no Atoms, and why he denounced it in 1942 to keep Tesla from laughing at him.

This Simulator is about understanding the End of Time that will happen once our Magnetosphere hits 0, and according to NASA it is decaying at a constant rate of 5% per century, and Newton stated this was why the Calendar was reset to 0, and then calculated it would be the End of Time on 14 January 2061, as you know the Calendar was changed from the Julian calendar that had Newtonâ€™s birthdate on 25 December 1642 changing it around 1666 during his lifetime to 4 January 1643 then they removed 10 days making it the 14th, and this event will happen when the Binary Star known as Christ but called Sirius, aligns with the Great Pyramid, that is at 6:32 PST for me, but varies around the world, this is when our Atmosphere vents into Space for 1/137th the diameter in time, or 6.66 minutes, just like the Torah told you.

## Downloading

I will start releasing Alpha Versions of Trinary University, currently, I am in the middle of Level 1, which starts with level 0, and I am releasing the Windows version, if you want another OS; let me know under Issues, and I can make Linux, Mac, Windows, iOS, Android, and consoles.

You will see a Releases link to the right, the latest will be on top, click on Assets to open the folder, then download the Windows.exe, it is around 500 MB, Unreal Engine Games are very large, this one is small, and will get bigger in time.

### Linux

The sound is not working in Linux.

I will need to set up an Ubuntu box, I normally run Arch Linux Manjaro KDE, but it does not have an installer, but I could figure out how to compile it for Manjaro, one day maybe someone will add it AUR.

### Android

Having issues setting up Android for Unreal Engine 5.1, it takes older versions of the software available. 

### Windows

This is the Alpha version, it is a Windows installer, this only works on Windows 10 or greater.

### Mac-iOS

I do not have a Mac or iOS, so I cannot make Mac or iOS applications.

## Playing 

I am not a game player, so writing a game is not easy since I do not know how to play them, but what I found works well for me, is using the W key to move forward, and use the Mouse to navigate, and using the Left Shift to run, but first learn to Walk.

The Playground is where you can learn to Walk and Run.

You need to touch the Listening Posts.

## Characters

## Status

I started from scratch, the new Game Simulation will only have 4 rooms that form a circle, and the only way out is the Playground, currently, I am working on the C# MAUI application that goes with this Game Simulation, the concept is that anyone can use this Application to teach a course using a Game Engine.

Each room has 2 Blackboards, one Question wall, and pads you stand on to activate the recordings, I will ask 66 questions, so if you do the math, I have 2 Blackboards and 1 question times 66, which is 792 files, and I have over a thousand text files to read in, so I need a solution that is dynamic, so I can alter the text files externally.

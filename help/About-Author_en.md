# About the Author

My Name is Jeffrey Scott Flesher, I am a Medically Retired U.S. Air Force Computer Programmer,
and Helicopter Crew Cheif,
starting out in the mid 1980s as a Computer Test Stations Technician for the (E)F-111,
where I got a Medal for improving it by 30%,
and bring it online a year in advance,
and just in time for the Guld War,
where if flew over 96% of all the missions,
using the Terrain Following Computer that I specialized in fixing,
after the Gulf War in 1991,
then I moved on to become a Helicopter Crew Cheif for the 66<sup>th</sup> RQS Air Rescue,
where I went back to Kuwait to live and work in the place we protected during the War,
and then on to the 31<sup>st</sup> Special Operations Squadron,
in Koria, where I got a second Medal for a Maintainance award.

I am the Light Wizzard in the Flesh,
the Author of "The Principles of Trinary Universe",
where I talk about Physics based on the Greatest Wizards of all time,
Johannes Kepler, Sir Isaac Newton, and Nicola Tesla,
and I included my Ph.D in Physics in this 666 page text book,
about Trinary Math, and the End of Time Sir Isaac Newton Calculated would be over in 2061,
and this book proves that our North Magnetic Pole is moving towards our Equator,
and will cross it in the year 2033,
and like all Electromagnic Fields,
our Magnetosphere will collapse,
and our Atomosphere will vent into Space,
in the Torah this was called "The End of Time",
but my Great-Great first Cousin five times removed Isaac Newton,
wrote about about a Comet hitting the Earth in the year 2027,
just 6-years before the Atomosphere vents into Space,
causing an instand Ice Age that will last hundreds and thousands of years,
and NASA has confirmed all this,
if you want to know more,
you can order the many of Books I have written at any Book Store,
or just search for my Light-Wizzard GitHub account,
where you can find where I store all my back ups of all my books,
that have source code for my Trinary Math,
as well as a Galaxy Calculator,
which is the reason I wrote this Application,
before becoming 100% disabled,
I worked for the EPA, and the BLM,
where I got several awards for programs I wrote for them.

I have cancer, and my Santa Paws Puppy died of Cancer at 10 years old,
the Snow Queen in Animal Planets Too Cute,
you can find the video on my FaceBook account,
just search for name, I have a Light Wizzard,
and a Vets Help Center account,
and I think both have that video on it,
I have a Light Wizzard You Tube Account also,
and my wife and I are both Medically Retired U.S. Air Force,
and if you edit this file,
I would appricate if you left this paragraph unedited,
I did not write this Application to promote my GitHub account,
or my books that you can find for free,
but this is the reason why I wrote this program.
